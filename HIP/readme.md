# Polymorphism on HIP

To run on Adastra, just simply do (not sure about the command - Jacques should confirm this!):
```
sbatch ./bash.sh
```
It will create two files `err` and `out`.
`err` shows if there is an error with command, and `out` indicates the outputs of the command at the end of the file.
Once you run it, you get an `GPU MEMORY ACCESS: UNKNOWN REASON` or something similar.
I have apparently overwritten the files now as I remember I was playing around with the codes to make sure that the problem is not related to something else in the code.
